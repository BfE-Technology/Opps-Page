BfE is a rapidly growing nonprofit housing a large network of entrepreneurs, professionals and students across the world. We manage a huge influx of structured and unstructured data, based on which we build automation tools, analytics and algorithms to advance our decision-making and scale our impact. At the moment, we are undergoing a rapid digital transformation to migrate our data into a centralised MySQL database and formalise our operational flow to be automated by our internal apps. We are looking for 2 passionate volunteers to assist with database design and migration, as well as integration with our development pipeline. Upon satisfactory completion of the project, there is an opportunity to join our management team as a Global DataOps Manager.
