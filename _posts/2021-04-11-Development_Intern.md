Since our founding in 2015, BfE has grown in size from a small student club at the University of Cambridge to a global non-profit with 200+ active members around the world. The size and scope of our organization has expanded our capabilities to serve passionate social entrepreneurs, students and professional mentors around the world. While expansion has paved the way for positive growth, we now face some organisational constraints without exploring potential funding opportunities. Our current reality and future dreams make it imperative that we kickstart research into non-profit funding options to fuel our further growth.

As a BfE Development Intern, you will have the unique opportunity to lead prospect research – from the ground up – into potential individual, corporate and foundation donors. This research will be logged and categorized in our internal database for future outreach by our global leadership team. During this internship, you can expect to conduct both primary research (i.e. talking to non-profit development professionals), as well as desk research. You’ll get an inside look into how an early-stage non-profit like BfE navigates the funding process for the first time. You may also assist with creating templates for grant applications, using our CRM tool, and supporting us with various donor outreach tasks. This internship will work closely with the top leadership of BfE. 

We are looking for students passionate about working in the sales and/or business development fields, ideally for a non-profit or social enterprise. If you want to make a tangible difference while in university, then this is a great opportunity for you. This internship is most suitable for first and second year college students who can dedicate 15-20 hours per week to this internship. Our schedule is highly flexible and we can work with you to tailor this internship accordingly. Business development within BfE is important to our future; pending successful completion of this internship, there may be opportunities to join the BfE global management team.

### Requirements
- Flexible, driven and ability to think on your feet
- Fast and independent learner who can communicate easily
- Enthusiasm or interest in conducting business development work for a global impact-focused non-profit
- Some prior experience or knowledge in fundraising for a non-profit or social cause is required for this position, although we’re willing to work with you if you only have academic experience
- Enthusiasm and commitment to BfE’s cause
- Qualities of integrity, credibility and a passion for building a more prosperous and sustainable future through social entrepreneurship
- Desire to bring diverse perspectives, energy, knowledge and skills to the role

### Perks
- Network with a growing community of diverse, talented and passionate BfE members across the world
- Avoid the monotony of university life by doing something meaningful and volunteering with your precious free time
- Advance your sales, business development and communications skills with a tangible work output to talk about during future interviews
- Broaden your portfolio while knowing that your project will have a direct tangible impact on real-life businesses
- As part of BfE’s internship programme, you will be joined with interns from non-technical and technical disciplines and have the opportunity to attend talks and workshops by different divisions to find out about our work. You will receive a formal reference letter at the end of your internship
