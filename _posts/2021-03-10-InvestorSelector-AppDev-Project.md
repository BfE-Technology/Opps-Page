BfE has over 5 years of experience in providing quality finance advisory services to social entrepreneurs around the world. Among many possible services we provide, one of them is to provide a list of recommendation of funding sources that our entrepreneurs can apply to. This has been a very manual process being done by team members across the world, which often results in searching for duplicate data from similar sources.

Investor selector is a smart database proposed by BfE Technology to centralise and automate data collection. We are looking for 1 back-end developer and 1 or more front-end developers to build the app based on our existing back-end prototype and provide it with a flexible front-end interface. The project may also involve integrating our in-house machine learning algorithm to the app. 

If you are more interested in machine learning, you may want to check the [**sister project**](https://opps.bridgesforenterprise.com/global/cambridge/singapore/newyork/rotterdam/vancouver/technology) for the investor selector.
