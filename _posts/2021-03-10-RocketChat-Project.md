As a global nonprofit that is managing a large network of entrepreneurs, professionals and students and that is constantly scaling our pro-bono incubation services, we face the challenge of keeping our global community connected and providing our users an integral experience in using BfE's online platforms. This project will form the last missing pillar in BfE's digital ecosystem, allowing us to manage a self-hosted chat platform tailored to internal needs and synced with other internal tools. You will be setting up a basic version of [**Rocket.Chat**](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat), one of the (if not the most) famous open-source chat platforms used by many other open source projects. You will be tasked with

1. investigating and implementing the best architecture for Rocket Chat on Azure, AWS or Digital Ocean
2. setting up a DevOps pipeline for the project from version control to CD/CI following BfE's existing DevOps protocol
3. using your creativity to plan out how this platform should interface with other existing tools in BfE's system and implement some basic features (optional)

You are given a lot of freedom on point 3 and will work closely with our Product Manager and Global Technology Leadership for the planning. The ultimate goal is not to deliver an instantly usable end product, but a barebone version with robust infrastructure that allows future developers to come in and implement new features easily.

Upon finishing this project, if you wish to continue, you may join us as a tech lead to recruit and manage a team of developers for implementing the features you plan out.
