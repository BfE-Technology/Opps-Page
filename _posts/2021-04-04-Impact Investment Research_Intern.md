BfE has over 5 years of experience in providing quality incubation services to social entrepreneurs around the world. During our 6-8 month pro bono Incubation Programme, we strive to connect our portfolio startups to suitable investment opportunities for their business. Although we’re unable to invest in our startups directly, we aim to provide a ‘bridge’ to additional capital sources that can enable the startup to grow and generate a greater social impact. 

We are currently building out a comprehensive database of funding opportunities for our startups and need your research support. Information contained in this database will be segmented into various categories to better match startups with investment capital. This database will eventually form the backend data that feeds into a proprietary tech-enabled investor selector tool for BfE teams to leverage during their startup engagements. 

We are looking for students passionate about the early-stage funding landscape for social enterprises. If you have a background or interest in venture funding, and want to learn more about startup finance in emerging/frontier markets, then this is a great opportunity for you. This internship is most suitable for high school seniors and first and second year college students who can dedicate 15-20 hours per week to this internship. Our schedule is highly flexible and we can work with you to tailor this internship accordingly.

### Perks
