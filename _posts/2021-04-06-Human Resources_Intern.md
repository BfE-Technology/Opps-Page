Since our founding in 2015, BfE has grown in size from a small student club at the University of Cambridge to a global non-profit with 200+ active members around the world. While we have grown in size, we still face difficulties with talent retention, performance and engagement, and sustainable succession within BfE chapters. Some of this is due to our all-volunteer nature, yet there are certainly improvements that can be made in a number of areas that touch upon human resources (HR). Until now, addressing these challenges has been the job of the BfE global management team. Going forward, however, we are hoping to recruit someone with a background or interest in HR to strategize ways to improve some of these underlying weaknesses in our organizational design.

This internship will work closely with the top leadership of BfE. Through various 1:1 and group sessions, this intern will collect detailed feedback from past and present chapter leadership and perform analysis to understand each chapter's struggles and success in recruitment and retention. Deliverables at the end of the internship will be a presentation of findings + some initial suggestions that each chapter, as well as our global team, can use. 

We are looking for students passionate about going into the HR field. If you have a background or interest in social impact and non-profits, and want to make a tangible difference while in university, then this is a great opportunity for you. This internship is most suitable for first and second year college students who can dedicate 15-20 hours per week to this internship. Our schedule is highly flexible and we can work with you to tailor this internship accordingly. Human resources within BfE is incredibly important; pending successful completion of this internship, there may be opportunities to join the BfE global management team afterwards.

### Perks
