BfE has over 5 years of experience in providing quality incubation services to social entrepreneurs around the world. At the core of our operations lies a wide array of technical tools we use for efficient remote collaboration. As we rapidly scale the organisation and expand the toolset we use, a secure way of sharing passwords and secrets becomes a high priority in our operation.

This project focuses on building our first self-hosted password manager based on the popular open-source project [**Passbolt**](https://www.passbolt.com/) on BfE's Azure server. Check out [**this cool video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lQQojXLWSQ) about what it does; the community is also actively developing its mobile version that will be launched soon. You will get hands-on experience on building up an app deployment pipeline from scratch and automating cloud server configurations. 

Once the setup is done, the rest of the project focuses on automated assignment of password permissions triggered by user role updates. On the technical end, you will expose yourself to building custom API endpoints and designing protocols for secure cross-server communications. On the business end, you will learn about internal operations in a large global nonprofit like Bridges for Enterprise, and have the opportunity to propose strategic changes to our operation flow.

We are looking for two passionate students to work on this project alongside our Global Team this summer. At the end of the internship, subject to your performance, you will have the opportunity to apply for one of our chapter or global roles and sharpen your technical leadership skills while contributing to our cause.
