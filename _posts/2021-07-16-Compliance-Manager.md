Since our founding in 2015, BfE has grown in size from a small student club at the University of Cambridge to a global non-profit with 300+ active volunteers working with 100+ startups around the world. As our organisation structure becomes more complex, so are the compliance challenges in making sure we operate in accordance with internal policies and external regulations, both locally and globally. The problems we face are very unique given our all-volunteer nature, our nonprofit status and our remote working mode. We are looking for a volunteer with background in corporate compliance to join our global management team in strategy, operations and technology. You will be the mastermind for designing, improving and managing our internal compliance policies and external agreements, with our Legal Advisors being an available point of consultation.

- Prior experience in risk management or compliance is strongly preferred
- Driven, passionate and committed to BfE's cause
- Strong verbal and written communication skills
- Superior attention to details and ability to identify potential areas of risk
- Excellent analytical skills and ability to accurately interpret complex workflows, documents and policies
- Strong time management and organizational skills
- Strong moral code and ethics

### Perks
- Network with a growing community of diverse, talented and passionate BfE professionals, students and entrepreneurs across the world
- Avoid the monotony of corporate life by doing something meaningful and volunteering with your precious free time
- Advance your risk management, compliance and/or business operation management skills while knowing that your work will have a tangible social impact on real-life social entrepreneurs
- Join the global management team of a fast growing nonprofit and share our joy in helping the organisation grow
