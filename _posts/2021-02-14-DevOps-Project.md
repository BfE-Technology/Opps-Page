DevOps is a vital aspect of any growing codebase shared by multiple collaborators that are delivering products live to the users. BfE has a preliminary internal CD/CI workflow to automate product testing and deployment. Depending on your level of experience with DevOps, this project will entail **one** of the following tasks (in the order of increasing technical difficulty):

1. Understanding and documenting the current workflow in a clean and precise manner for the developers. Research about other standard DevOps practices, evaluate the current workflow and come up with a plan for future improvements

2. Design sensible Unit Tests for PHP and Javascript (and optionally Python Django / Flask) codes in our existing pipeline automated by GitHub Actions

3. Redesign our workflow and deployment to incorporate a Content Delivery Network for more efficient serving of images, taking care of the various needs at development, testing and production and making the process as smooth as possible. You will learn about Terraform (infrastructure-as-code) and Azure in this work
