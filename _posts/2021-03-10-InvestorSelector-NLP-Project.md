BfE has over 5 years of experience in providing quality finance advisory services to social entrepreneurs around the world. Among many possible services we provide, one of them is to provide a list of recommendation of funding sources that our entrepreneurs can apply to. This has been a very manual process being done by team members across the world, which often results in searching for duplicate data from similar sources.

Investor selector is a smart database proposed by BfE Technology to centralise and automate data collection. We are looking to develop an algorithm that combines common statistical tools and NLP algorithm and predicts ranking of a given list of investors for a given startup, leveraging on both structured and unstructured data. You will be tasked with

1. Developing a baseline algorithm for benchmarking
2. Generating simulated data to augment your training set
3. Iteratively testing different techniques until the algorithm reaches a desirable level of performance
4. Packaging your code for shipping with our application
