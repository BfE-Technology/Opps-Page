Since our founding in 2015, BfE has grown in size from a small student club at the University of Cambridge to a global non-profit with 200+ active members around the world. Our decentralised model and multiple target audiences has made it more challenging for people in BfE to know the right communication messages, channels and tactics to spread at the optimal time. This reality makes it imperative for us to create a centralized communications document that details these pointers for our organisation. You will lead this initiative.

We are also seeking ways to expand our audience through targeted outreach in select media outlets. If you have a background in public relations, media or communications, then this opportunity is perfect for you. During this role, you will be spearheading media outreach on behalf of BfE, while also seeking press for select startups in our portfolio. As such, you will have the chance to speak with the social entrepreneurs we serve by helping to shine a light on their businesses and showcase why they’re an attractive candidate for further investment.

We are looking for PR, media or comms students passionate about our mission to democratise access to advisory services for social enterprises in the developing world. This internship is most suitable for first and second year college students who can dedicate 15-20 hours per week to this internship. Our schedule is highly flexible and we can work with you to tailor this internship accordingly.

### Requirements
- Flexible, driven and ability to think on your feet
- Fast and independent learner who can communicate easily
- Enthusiasm or interest in conducting media outreach and communications work for a global impact-focused non-profit
- Some prior experience in public relations and media outreach is required for this position, although we’re willing to work with you if you only have academic experience
- Enthusiasm and commitment to BfE’s cause
- Qualities of integrity, credibility and a passion for building a more prosperous and sustainable future through social entrepreneurship
- Desire to bring diverse perspectives, energy, knowledge and skills to the role

### Perks
- Network with a growing community of diverse, talented and passionate BfE members across the world
- Avoid the monotony of university life by doing something meaningful and volunteering with your precious free time
- Advance your media and communications skills with a tangible work output to talk about during future interviews
- Broaden your portfolio while knowing that your project will have a direct tangible impact on real-life businesses
- As part of BfE’s internship programme, you will be joined with interns from non-technical and technical disciplines and have the opportunity to attend talks and workshops by different divisions to find out about our work. You will receive a formal reference letter at the end of your internship
