# Opportunities Listing

## Add a posting

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder in this GitHub repository. Name it as "YYYY-MM-DD-somename.md", replacing "YYYY-MM-DD" with the date of creation and "somename" as the title of the role (this will only show in the url so you can use shortcut). 

2. Copy and paste the following code:
```
---
title: "[Project] DevOps Unit Test Design"
smallprint: "Project Length: 6 hrs/week for 2-3 weeks. Experience Required: Medium."
summary: "some one-paragraph summary" # this will be visible on platforms like LinkedIn when sharing
categories: [Global, Technology]
---
``` 
Then,
- replace "\[Project\]" with "\[Role\]" or "\[Internship\]" if needed, and replacing "DevOps Unit Test Design" with the corresponding title.
- replace smallprint with some short info to display. It is recommended to specify Project Length / Commitment Level, and/or Experience Required / Difficulty Level here. Do not make it too long.
- replace summary with some one-paragraph information. Note that this will appear with the url when you share the post on social media, so write something succinct and compelling.
- replace categories with one or more of the following options so that filtering and related opening recommendations can work properly:

    - finance-advisory, legal-advisory, consulting, technical-advisory, communications, startup-recruitment, growth-partnerships, internal-technology
    - incubation, outreach, operations, impact-research, technology
